Hi, I have tried to create the screens as close to the design as possible. I have used similar icons/designs when I was unable to find/extract the exact thing.

You can tap n the plus icon to get the bottomSheet and the list icon to get the popup.

I haven't used any state management tools at all in this codebase and have build a screen on the modal sheet as part of the optional requirements.
